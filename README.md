# SmurfsMaze
This maze game was developed by me as an assignment for Web Advanced Topics in Programming course in Ben Gurion University. 

## Algorithms
This is a java project that involved creating and solving a maze by using a variety of algorithms: 
  * A maze generating algorithm implements Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.
  * A maze solving algorithm implements Best First Search (BFS) algorithm.
  
## Architecture
This project implemented by using MVVM architecture and Client-Server model based on multi-threading for the back-end side and JavaFX code for the front-end side.

## The Game 
The game lets you get a hint about the next recommanded step based on the solving algorithm and in case you give up you can reveal the whole path to the wining!
However, if you choose to quit and return later the program let you save it and reopen the game later on. (by exporting and inporting files)
